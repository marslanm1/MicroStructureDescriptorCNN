## Introduction

The hybrid CBIR model leverages the strengths of both MSD and CNNs to improve retrieval accuracy and speed. This approach addresses limitations in traditional CBIR systems, offering robust performance for real-world applications.

## Features

- **Micro-Structural Descriptors (MSD):** Captures fine-grained image features.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs):** Extracts deep, high-level features.
- **Hybrid Approach:** Combines MSD and CNN outputs for improved retrieval.
- **Performance Metrics:** Includes retrieval time analysis.
